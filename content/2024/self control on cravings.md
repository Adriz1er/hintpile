To don't crave we can't switch off craving ^[[source](https://youtu.be/tTb3d5cjSFI?si=lfPizPgYqNRN6erH&t=353)], because we can't control craving.
Therefore we have to know that we are craving if this is really the case, even if we regret this fact. 

When we see that we are craving we have usually loathing for what we unfortunately will craving if this is the case, this feeling shows us the importance of **giving up to crave**
